  calia_events.2.desc: "As I walk on the outskirts of my camp to clear my head, I quickly get lost in my thoughts. The wind passes through the naked branches and the clouds are bathed in moonlight. I even think I hear a bird when a twig cracks behind me.\n\n"It's you!" the intruder says "I wasn't sure from afar, but you really are [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"\n\nThe hairs on my body stand as my panicked mind fleetingly seeks an escape, but the armored figure kneels before me and plants [royal_guard.GetHerHis] sword in the ground.\n\n"I was—I am a member of the Royal Guard of Lordaeron." [royal_guard.GetSheHe] stammers "I thought I failed the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyNameNoTooltip], but [royal_guard.GetFaith.HighGodName] led me to you!"\n"I beg you, [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], allow me to serve you once more.""

  calia_events.3.desc: "I watch in the distance as the breeze caresses my face. We have traveled far and wide, visited numerous villages, and met a diverse number of people. We are now far from Lordaeron.\n\nAfter all these years, I can no longer call Lordaeron my home. Undead creatures and bloodthirsty warlords own these lost lands. Nobody there can call themselves alive anymore.\n\nBut here, we can start again. I am no longer a [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip], and neither are my people.\nIt is now time to call ourselves something different."
